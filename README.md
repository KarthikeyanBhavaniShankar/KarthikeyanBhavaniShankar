### 🚗 Autonomous Navigation System (Capstone Project)
**Technologies:** ROS 2, Python, C++, EKF, Ubuntu, RViz2, Jetson AGX Orin  

- Designed and implemented a real-time **GNSS–IMU localization system** using ROS 2 and an Extended Kalman Filter.  
- Deployed on **Jetson AGX Orin** with Linux systemd services for automated GNSS + RTK data streaming.  
- Optimized EKF parameters to reduce positional drift by **80 %** in GNSS-compromised environments.  
- Visualized localization accuracy in **RViz2** and validated through outdoor field testing.  
- Collaborated with LiDAR and mapping teams integrating **costmaps** and **occupancy grids**.
